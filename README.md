<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Tina ðŸ‘‹</h1> 

Currently, I work as a Security Engineer, where I am responsible for managing the SCA tool, Mend (WhiteSource).

My research focuses on implementing DecSecOps and enhancing product quality and security. I also worked as a QA engineer for 1 year in the electronic payment app and Security Operations Center (SOC) domains.

I am passionate about Security and Quality Testing and sharing considerations when using open sources.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect!
